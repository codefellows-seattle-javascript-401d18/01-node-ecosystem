# Lab1 Docs:

All files & folders I added to this lab are under the folder lab-isaiah.

Included the following required files and folders:
- README.md (this file)
- .gitignore (as provided)
- .eslintrc (as provided)
- .eslintignore (as provided)
- lib/ (contains arithmetic.js & greet.js)
- test/ (contains arithmetic.test.js & greet.test.js)
- Also included package.json & node_modules

Completed required Feature Tasks with Testing in mind. Added console.log per lib/files to provide additional information once Testing goes from RED to GREEN.

Created Tests to fail first, then adjusted to pass. Modified test/functions/console.log's to insure tests were sound and appropriate.

Refactored code to successfully implement bonus requirements in the tests that I had and adjusted console.log's in a way to reflect refactoring.
