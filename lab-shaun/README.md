This forked repo is to show my understanding and usage of learning how to test in the TDD format. I used Jest as my testing framework. I felt that I have a fairly decent grasp on how to write test for my first time however, I'm still a little unsure on the TDD method.

Hopefully it will sink in soon. 

All tests pass!
