## Node ecosystem lab

This first lab is to help us understand how to write node module tests.

1. We first configured our document with the appropriate files, configurations, tools that are required.
The .eslintignore, .eslintrc, .gitignore, package.json and package-lock.json.
2. Added appropriate scaffolding. I added my __test__ folder for my node modules aka my test files. And then I added my lib (libuv) folder for my js files.
3. Wrote code.
4. Ran jest test (npm install -D jest to start then npm test thereafter).

I collaborated with Michelle, Isaiah, Said, Katherine, Isaac.
