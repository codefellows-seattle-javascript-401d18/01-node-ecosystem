## Lab 1
This is a lab where we made some simple tests using node modules. 

## What the lab instructions were:
- We needed to create tests for:
  - Function that accepts a string and returns 'hello (string)!'
  - Function that can add and subtract two numbers
  - Arguments for these functions needed to be forced to be strings and numbers respectively, otherwise return null or an error message respectively
