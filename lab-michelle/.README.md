## Lab 1
This is a lab where we made some simple tests using node modules.


## What the lab instructions were:
Testing

write a test the expects the greet module to return "hello world!"
this should happen when invoked with "world!" as a parameter
write a test for the add and subtract methods on the arithmetic module
this should ensure that your functions work with number inputs

Feature Tasks

create a node.js module (greet.js) that exports a single function
the greet function should have a single parameter that should expect a string as it's input
the greet function should return the input name, concatenated with "hello "
the greet function should return null if the input is not a string
create a node.js module named arithmetic.js
this module should have add and sub methods
the add method should contain 2 parameters
these parameters should be numbers and the method should return the sum of the 2 numbers
the sub method should contain 2 parameters
these parameters should be numbers and the method should return the first number minus the second number
decide on the expected behavior for non-number inputs
